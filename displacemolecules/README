--------------------------------------------------------

calcite-slab.pdb is a pbd file, readable for VMD.
It contains a small calcite (CaCO3) slab.

executable bash scripts:

displacemolecules_vmd.sh contains input parameters
that can be tweaked in order to get the desired outcome
of displacing two input molecules (pdb files), aligning
them in the z-direction according to their geometrical
center.

vmd_dispmolecules.sh is called from dispmolecules_vmd.sh

vmd_dispmolecules.sh creates a temporaty file readable
to VMD, which is executed. The final configuration is
written as a pdb file.

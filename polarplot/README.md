## Create polar plots of function z

We aimed to use this plot for showing the center to surface interaction potential as a function of
distance r from the surface and direction theta (U(r,theta)), for a particle with diameter sigma. 

The roughness (kappa) of the particle can be changed as well as the number of surface plates (slices).

A plot with kappa=1 and slices=200, looks like:

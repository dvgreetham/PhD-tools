### Compute the interaction potential of two spherical colloids for different surface roughesses

We start from the interaction potential of two flat surfaces found from atomistic simulations of two calcite surfaces:

* Brekke-Svaland and Bresme "Interactions Between Hydrated Calcium Carbonate Surfaces at Nanoconfinement Conditions" (2018)

The free energy of separating the two hydrated surfaces is the integral of the disjoining pressure. 
This free energy per surface area, can be related to the force between two colloidal particles, using the Derjaguin approximation.
Finally, we find the interaction potential of two spherical particles taking the negative integral of the force.

Surface roughness is added using two different approaches:

	1) Gaussian concolution, assuming a continuous (smooth) distribution of surface steps
	2) Random sampling of discrete surface heights. Assuming steps of the same size as for the calcite surface.

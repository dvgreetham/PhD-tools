setup simulation of a calcite-water system with the (10.4) surface of calcite facing the water along the z-axis.
The systems are periodic in the xy-plane.
Vacuum is added along the z-direction

1) slab
	start from a pre-equilibrated slab of calcite
	adding water molecules on top of the surface

2) N-unitcells
	start from a unitcell of calcite with the (10.4) surface facing in z-dir.
	replicate the system (create a slab/supercell)
	add water molecules on top of the uneqilibrates slab
